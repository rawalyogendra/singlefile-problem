## Single File CLI Download Problem:

- `Manually Downloaded Page.html` is downloaded using the SingleFile browser extension - it is 3.9 MB in size and has all stylesheets and scripts.
- `CLI Downloaded Page.html` is downloaded using [single-file-cli](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/single-file-cli) and Playwright - it is only 210 KB and the stylesheets and scripts do not load.

I want to figure out how to make the CLI behave like the browser extension.
